## Requirements for Course Credit

To be awarded credit, you must earn at least **60 points** during the semester.

A total of **100 points** can be earned:
- **35 points** – Activity (17 points) + Written tests (3 × 6 points)
- **65 points** – Semester work

The semester assessment is reflected in the final exam. If you cannot attend an exercise session, you may arrange
an individual approach.

**Semester Assessment:**
- **0 - 59 points** = **C** (Not suitable for course credit)
- **60 - 79 points** = **B** (Credit awarded)
- **80 - 100 points** = **A** (Credit awarded with excellent performance, easier final exam!)

### Tests

Planned dates for the written tests (during exercises):
- **Exercise 04** _(March 4, 2025)_
- **Exercise 08** _(April 1, 2025)_
- **Exercise 11** _(April 22, 2025)_

### Points for Semester Work

The semester work is evaluated based on three main aspects:  
- **Proposal** (document "for the contracting authority" including all restrictions): 10 points  
- **Final report** (documentation, evaluation): 15 points  
- **Program Functionality**: 40 points  

**Use of AI Tools and Cheating:**  
Students are **allowed** to use AI-based tools such as **ChatGPT** or **Microsoft Copilot** when working on their
semester work. However, the use of these tools must be **explicitly stated** in the final report _(acknowledgment)_,
even if they were used only for text analysis or reviewing code.  
Failing to report the use of AI tools will lead to a **point deduction**:

- **Final report**: -5 points
- **Program Functionality**: -25 points

Any form of **cheating**, such as copying another student's work, submitting AI-generated work as your own without
acknowledgment, or engaging in any other unfair practice, is strictly prohibited and may result in
**failing the course**.

## Exam

The exam is oral and covers the lectured material.
- Students who achieved a **B** in the semester draw **3 questions** and answer them after possible preparation.
- Students who achieved an **A** draw **3 questions** but answer only **2** of their choice.
